This is a social media app that connects Coptic Churches with Coptic Christians. 

Users will be able to login in to their account and see posts from accounts they have followed. They can see updates from churches they are linked to so they are up-to-date with all church events, news, and more! 

Users will be able to sign-up, post, and comment on posts. 

Hopefully this will make it easier for users to find a church and stay connected with its nearby community!
